# TypeScript Training Course

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) is a language that adds types and new features to JavaScript. It compiles down to JavaScript that can be used in any browser.

This course covers the fundamental building blocks of writing an application in TypeScript. It intentionally does not cover the entire TypeScript language, focussing instead on the features that are most commonly used. For a full reference, see the [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html).

## Prerequisites

This course is not intended for beginners to web development - you should have some prior knowledge of JavaScript, up to ES5.

Knowledge of ES2015/2016/2017 is desirable but not essential.

## Course Structure

The course comprises of:

 - a set of [notes](./notes/), which will be presented as slides in person
 - a series of [challenges](https://github.com/studiozeffa/typescript-training-challenges), to be completed after each set of notes.
